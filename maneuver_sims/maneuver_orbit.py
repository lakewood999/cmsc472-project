    """
    Calculate the difference in orbital radii after a Delta V maneuver.

    Makes the assumption that the initial and post-maneuver orbits are circular.
    Since the target object will typically be a menuvering spacecraft, the assumption
    is that its orbit is relatively circular. The post-maneuever spacecraft is also assumed to be 
    circular because the ESA dataset doesn't provide true anomaly, and so we can't truly know how the orbit 
    changes. We make an average approximation as the average distances between the two objects, 
    given an eccentic orbit, can be approximated by a circular orbit of same potential energy.

    Parameters:
    - a (float): Initial semi-major axis (meters)
    - delta_v (float): Delta V applied (meters per second)
    - mu (float): Gravitational parameter (m^3/s^2). Default is Earth's mu.

    Returns:
    - delta_r (float): Difference in orbital radii (meters)
    - a_new (float): New orbital radius after maneuver (meters)
