* The main notebooks with the models used along with the data processing and cleaning are `LSTM_FC_Final.ipynb` and
`TST_Final.ipynb`
* `472_final_project_feature_selection.ipynb` and `random_forest_RFE_feature_selection.ipynb` contains code used for initial data exploration and feature selection
* The final results of feature selection are in the "dataset" notebooks, although most of those results are incorporated
  in the above notebooks
